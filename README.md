# STL_Learning

I am used to go the easy way and use STL everywhere without thinking much about how it all works.
With this project, I try to experiment with the implementation of my own STL-like types.
My goal is to face challenges and think about how the STL types work internally.

## Desired types

The idea started off with wanting to try to create a Vector and String class.
The goal is to expand to some more interesting containers like hashmaps, linked lists, ...

## Goals

* Learning the workings of STL types
* Face challenges that require some good thinking
